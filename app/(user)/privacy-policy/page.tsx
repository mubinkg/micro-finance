          Financial companies choose how they share your personal information.
          Federal and Tribal law gives consumers the right to limit some, but
          not all, sharing. Federal and Tribal law also requires us to tell you
          how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please
          read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} className="mb-4">

          How?

          How does ZimbaCash protect my personal information?
        </p>

        <p>
          To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use,
          we use security measures that comply with federal and Tribal law.
          These measures include computer safeguards such as 256-bit AES
          encryption of data in transit and at rest, as well as hosting IaaS
          under AWS standard.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} className="mb-4">
          How does ZimbaCash collect my personal information?
        </p>
        <p>We collect your personal information, for example, when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply for a loan</li>
          <li>Give us your income information</li>
          <li>Provide employment information</li>

        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} className="mb-4">
          Why can’t I limit all sharing?
        </p>
        <p>Federal and Tribal law gives you the right to limit only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes – information
            about your creditworthiness (ZimbaCash does not share this
            information);
          </li>
          <li>Affiliates from using your information to market to you;</li>
          <li>Sharing for non-affiliates to market to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} className="mb-4">
          What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with
          someone else?
        </p>
        <p>ZimbaCash does not provide joint accounts.</p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} className="mb-4">
